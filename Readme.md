# Magnus Effect — 2D Visualization [ GPU only ]

Real-time 2D visualization of the Magnus effect (lift generated by a spinning ball) using C++, OpenGL 4.3, GLFW, GLAD, and CMake.
Wind lines advect from left → right, interact with a spinning ball in the center, and get deflected by a simple physical model. Lines fade blue when they deviate from their straight path; otherwise they’re white. Spin can be changed at runtime.

#Quick physics
- Base flow (freestream): constant wind speed 𝑈∞ along +X.
- Magnus / circulation term: spin induces circulation Γ around the ball. We map the ball’s angular speed ω to circulation with a scaled cylinder relation
# Γ≈kΓ​(2πR2)ω
where kΓ is a tunable scale.

- Velocity field
  # v(x,y)=(U∞​,0)+vvortex​(x,y)
  with 𝑣 vortex a smoothed point-vortex induced velocity whose strength decays with distance and is clamped inside a core radius so it doesn’t blow up near the center.
- Magnus “reach”: we attenuate the vortex with a radial falloff
- Advection: each line is a string of particles that move with 𝑣 Δ𝑡
        vΔt. When a line exits at the right border, it respawns at the left border (constant seeding).
  The spin builds up while you hold Left/Right and decays smoothly when released (exponential decay).

This is a didactic model: visually captures the Magnus effect and the downstream swirl without solving Navier–Stokes.
